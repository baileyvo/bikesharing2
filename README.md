## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate to investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be a solid business proposal, by doing analysis of the program in New York City, and seeing what trends emerge that could be used to ensure the Des Moines program is successful.

### Resources
- Data Source: [Citi Bike Trip Histories](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)- 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
- Software: Tableau Public

## Results

### Visualizations
A number of visualizations were created, including:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- Starting and ending locations of trips

### Tableau Story
The Tableau story visualization is available here: [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/8WCC4RJR3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

**Summary of Fare Differences by City Type**

### Description of Visualizations
To read a description of each visualization available in Tableau, please see below:
1. This line graph shows that the trip duration peaks at 5 minutes, and steadily declines from there.
2. This line graph shows males take more trips than the female or unknown groups, but they all take most trips in under an hour.
3. This heat map shows that trips are most common during the day on weekends, or during communte times on weekdays.
4. This heat map shows males take more trips, but all groups seem to follow the same day/time patterns.
5. This heat map shows male subscribers are the most common usertypes.
6. This map shows more trip starts are concentrated in downtown Manhattan.
7. This map shows more trip ends are concentrated in downtown Manhattan, mirroring where trips start.

## Summary
Overall, male subscribers commuting during rush hour seem to be the key demographic to target. Furthermore, the good news is that bike trips seem to start and end in roughly the same locations, so there would not be a need to transport bikes continually to where users are. Finally, this does seem like a good investment, if Des Moines follows similar demographic patterns as New York City.

Two addtional visualizations suggested for future analysis are:
1. Comparing trip duration to start time, and see if it is different on weekdays vs. weekends.
2. See how the age (birth year) compares to trips by weekday for each hour.
